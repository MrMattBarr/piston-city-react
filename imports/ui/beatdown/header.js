	      <p>"Plan your combo. Save the city together. â€” A fun, cooperative, strategic crime-fighting card game."</p>
	      <p>Beatdown is a 1-4 player fully cooperative card game. Players team up to defeat waves of comic-book criminal and eventually go toe-to-toe with a crime-boss that threatens their city. The group wins if they are able to reach and defeat the boss and lose if all players are simultaneously reduced to 0 hitpoints.</p>
	      <p>The core fighting mechanic revolves around building combos by using a mixture of attack cards in hand and from the shared "Attack" deck. Between each attack players must roll a 10-sided combo die to see if they can continue their attack. Each added attack increases the difficulty rating of this roll. A failed combo roll leaves an opening for enemies to attack.</p>
	      <p>At the start of the game each player chooses a hero with a unique stat-line and ability. Heroes tend to have roles for group play such as tanky wrestlers or fragile high-damage boxers. Planning the right team to bring can be crucial for defeating the foes that await.</p>
